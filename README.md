Language:-it is a commnuication barrier used by us to communicate with each other. In terms of programming language is barrier between human & a system or application(software)

language broadly classified as

           . Lowleve programming language 
           . Middlelevel programming language
           . highlevel programming lanaguage
           
-> In lowlevel programming language to give instruction to a machine ,We use assembly language.it comprise of mnemonics.

-> Next we use middle level programming language for communication .The best known example for this is 'c'. It comes well procedure oriented programmming language.
It use well structured steps and procedures  to bulid a program. In simple terms ,if is a collection of functions or porcedures ,mostly it uses english worrds as their  identifier

->Next, we started using high level programming languages for communication .The best example for  this JAVA . It comes under object oriented programming language.



* Differences  between procedures  oriented /structure oriented  and object  oriented programming

.            Procedure oriented programming language                                                        . Object oriented programming language 
           
. It is mainly focus on "Procces"                                                                           ' It mainly focus on "Data"
